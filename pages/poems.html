          <h4>Girls are behind the Screens</h4>
          For a month I’ve been touring<br>
          Around the remote villages developing<br>
          Just to know what they think<br>
          And what the girls there want to think<br>
          <br>
          They told they want them,<br>
          The girls, to stitch all their clothes per hem<br>
          But the girls said they want to study<br>
          Even when the season is rainy<br>
          <br>
          The elders have their own traditions<br>
          Giving the girls too many conditions<br>
          Oh, the girls were just too helpless<br>
          For the money they had too less<br>
          <br>
          In India, the population of boys<br>
          Has dominated the girls’ as toys<br>
          Though the govt. has passed laws<br>
          For a girl to live with no flaws<br>
          <br>
          The girls are still behind the screens<br>
          Why don’t we just open those screens<br>
          Let the girls come out of their cage<br>
          And dance and win out on the stage!

          <h4>Among the Stinking Wolves</h4>
          I stood there for a while<br>
          Among the dangerous vile<br>
          For I did not know how to do<br>
          Whatever I had to do<br>
          <br>
          I was stuck in such a situation<br>
          In, of course, the God’s creation<br>
          There I was all alone<br>
          But for the angry tone<br>
          <br>
          I’d been surrounded by those<br>
          Who made me hold up my nose<br>
          I couldn’t decide which was worse<br>
          That smell or the death curse<br>
          <br>
          I’d been packed up with them<br>
          The deadly group of ‘em<br>
          Oh, how much I wished<br>
          To escape from the wolves nourished

          <h4>Why not Monarchy?</h4>
          When the leaders are so irresponsible<br>
          Themselves chatting impossible<br>
          Isn’t it perhaps hope-able?<br>
          Why not monarchy?<br>
          <br>

          You're not next to me<br>
          You're not here when I need you bad<br>
          I know you love me<br>
          I know I'm prolly gettin what I deserve<br>

          Am I upset 'bout what you said<br>

          How do I tell you<br>
          The trauma I've been through<br>
          And what your words trigger<br>

          How do I explain to you<br>
          The turmoil in my head<br>
          And what I need from you <3
